Lucene KeyMatch
===============

Simple class to import KeyMatches from Google Enterprise and give KeyMatch functionality to Lucene.

The project contains a WPF project that contains the class contained in a visual test app to see what results you would get with search queries. Currently this does not take into account query syntax, but I'm not sure if Google Enterprise does that either.
